  - Those that directly affet the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic and the size of the text)
  
  - Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)
  
- Serif
  
  - Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are knows as serifs.
  
- Sans-serif
  
  - Sans-serif font have straight ends to letter, and therefore hae a much cleaner design.
  
- Monospace

  - Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths)
  
- Weight

  - The font weight not only adds emphasis but can also affect the amount of white space and contrast on a page
  
- Style
