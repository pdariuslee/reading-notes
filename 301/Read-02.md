# jQuery, Events, and The DOM

## JavaScript and jQuery book by Jon Duckett

### Events

- Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked)

- Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.

- When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.

- You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.

## [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

### By Allie Grampa

- How does pair programming work?

  - While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

- Why pair program?

  - Greater efficiency

  - Engaged collaboration

  - Learning from fellow students

  - Social skills

  - Job interview readiness

  - Work environment readiness
