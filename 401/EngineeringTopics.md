# Solving Problems

## [How to Solve Programming Problems by John Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

---

### Common Mistakes

- Saying: "Measure twice and cut once"

- Don't just dive in to solving problems (resist this urge)

- Read the problem at least twice and truly understand the problem

- Keep your solution simple, nothing fancy

---

### A simple set of steps

#### Applicable to algorithm type programming problem

- Read the problem completely twice.

- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

- Optimize the manual steps.

- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

- Optimize the real code.

- As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.

Let’s look at each step.

---

### Read the problem twice

- Maybe even 3-4 times, if that's what it takes

- Once you understand the problem, it's easier to solve it

---

### Solve the problem manually

- “Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!”

- Doing it manually helps understand the core concepts of what ever code or work you are doing

- In a given task, break it down to simpler-smaller tasks and ask yourself "What step is needed?" and "Why is it needed?"

---

### Optimize the manual solution

- After coming up with manual solution, look back what you can simplify in the process

---

### Write pseudo-code or comments

--- Key thing is outline the structure of the code we will write to solve the problem

### Replace comments with real code

- All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code

- If you struggle here, there are usually two possible reasons:

  - You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps

    - If you didn’t break the problem down enough, try going back to the second step and being as meticulous as possible.  Write out each and every single step.  I know it is a pain, but do it, believe me it will be worth the effort.

  - You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion

    - If you don’t know your programming language well enough to do the translation, you may need to brush up here on some basic constructs.  Any language you expect to be able to solve algorithm type problems in, you should know how to do the following things:

      - Create a list

      - Sort a list or array

      - Create a map or dictionary

      - Loop through a list, or dictionary

      - Parse strings

      - Convert from string to int, int to string, etc

#### If you don’t know how to do all of these things.  Stop what you are doing now and learn them. It’s not a very long list, and the benefits will be profound.

---

### Optimize the real code

- Find something to cut or do something simpler

- Good place to make sure variables are named with long meaningful names. VERY IMPORTANT! good names for variables and methods.

---

### A few final tips

- It takes a good amount of faith to believe that spending 70% of your 30 minutes to solve a problem just thinking about the problem and not writing any code is the right approach, so make sure you have that faith when you need it.

  - TopCoder

  - Codility.com

- Divide and conquer

  - Cut problem in half. A good way to know where to break a problem in half is to think about what part of the problem if already given to you would make solving the rest easy.

# Act like you make $1000/hr

- “Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas Göke

- “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss

- Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.

- “Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.” - Cal Newport

- Deep work means absolutely not tolerating distractions and producing monumental quality and quantity in a very short time. This is how you can complete far more with focused efforts than unfocused efforts with far more time.

- Do you want incredible productivity?
Then cultivate extreme focus with whatever you do.

- If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.
But if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.

- Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.

# [How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving by Richard Reis](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

- The best way involves a) having a framework and b) practicing it.

- So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

  - Here are the steps:

    - **Understand**

      - Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

      - How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

      - Do you remember being stuck on a problem, you start explaining it, and you instantly see holes in the logic you didn’t see before?

      - Most programmers know this feeling.

      - This is why you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it (or thing… some people use a rubber duck).

      - “If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman

    - **Plan**

      - Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

      - Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

      - In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

      - To get a good plan, answer this question:

      - “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

      - Sidenote: Programmers have a great tool to help them with this… Comments!

    - **Divide**

      - Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.

      - Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

      - Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

      - Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

      - After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.

      - Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

      - Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!

      - This technique is a cornerstone of problem-solving. Remember it (read this step again, if you must).

      - “If I could teach every beginning programmer one problem-solving skill, it would be the ‘reduce the problem technique.’
      For example, suppose you’re a new programmer and you’re asked to write a program that reads ten numbers and figures out which number is the third highest. For a brand-new programmer, that can be a tough assignment, even though it only requires basic programming syntax.
      If you’re stuck, you should reduce the problem to something simpler. Instead of the third-highest number, what about finding the highest overall? Still too tough? What about finding the largest of just three numbers? Or the larger of two?

      - Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.” — V. Anton Spraul

    - **Stuck?**

      - First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair.

      - Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!

      - In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:

        - Debug

        - Reassess

        - Research

        - Side note: Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes. I’m serious. You’ll be dumbfounded at how effective this is.

    - Practice

      - Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with `<insert concept here>`.”

      - How to practice? There are options out the wazoo!

      - Chess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games, cryptokitties, bla… bla… bla….

      - In fact, a common pattern amongst successful people is their habit of practicing “micro problem-solving.” For example, Peter Thiel plays chess, and Elon Musk plays video-games.

# [5 Whys - Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

- The 5 Whys technique is true to this tradition, and it is most effective when the answers come from people who have hands-on experience of the process or problem in question.

- The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.

- Note:
The 5 Whys uses "counter-measures," rather than "solutions." A counter-measure is an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem from arising again, while a solution may just seek to deal with the symptom. As such, counter-measures are more robust, and will more likely prevent the problem from recurring.

- When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis

  - Assemble a Team

  - Define the Problem

  - Ask the First "Why?"

  - Ask "Why?" Four More Times

  - Know When to Stop

  - Address the Root Cause(s)

  - Monitor Your Measures

- Key Points

  - The 5 Whys strategy is a simple, effective tool for uncovering the root of a problem. You can use it in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and quality-improvement initiatives.

  - Start with a problem and ask why it is occurring. Make sure that your answer is grounded in fact, and then ask the question again. Continue the process until you reach the root cause of the problem, and you can identify a counter-measure that will prevent it from recurring.

  - Bear in mind that this questioning process is best suited to simple or moderately difficult problems. Complex problems may benefit from a more detailed approach, although using 5 Whys will still give you useful insights.
