## [Getting started with React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)


### Prerequisites

To work with React Native, you will need to have an understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. If youâ€™re new to JavaScript or need a refresher, you can dive in or brush up at Mozilla Developer Network.

### Function Components and Class Components

With React, you can make components using either classes or functions. Originally, class components were the only components that could have state. But since the introduction of React's Hooks API, you can add state and more to function components.

Hooks were introduced in React Native 0.58., and because Hooks are the future-facing way to write your React components.

### The Basics

React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. So to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX, components, state, and props. If you already know React, you still need to learn some React-Native-specific stuff, like the native components.
