Common Terminology

Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure

Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree

Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node

Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node

Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children

Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

Traversals

An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

- Depth First
- Breadth First
