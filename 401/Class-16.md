### Overview

For the most recognizable example of Event-Driven Programming for people at any level of programming skill, we’ll turn to our old friend The Web Browser.

Every time you interact with a webpage through it’s user interface, an event is happening. When you click a button a click event is triggered. When you press a key a keydown event is triggered. These events have associated functions that, when triggered, are executed to make a change to the user interface in some way.

Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:

An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.


### EventEmitter

Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away. Of course, creating our own version of EventEmitter wouldn’t be much of a challange, and in fact there are several modules published on npm such as EventEmitter2 and EventEmitter3 which promise a faster performance than the native EventEmitter.

Those are both worth checking out if your project needs to run faster than EventEmitter will allow. They are both built to allow for syntax that is almost identical to what we’ll use for EventEmitter so learning one will make it easy to work with all of them.

We access the EventEmitter class through the events module. Once imported we’ll need to create a new object from the class to start using it.


### Removing Listeners

There will likely come a time when you want to remove an event listener from an event. This could be for performance reasons (the event is no longer needed) or to avoid memory leaks (if an event listener references an object that is no longer needed, it won’t be able to be garbage-collected. This can lead to a build up of unnecessary objects).

To remove event listeners in EventEmitter we can use the removeListener or removeAllListeners method. It’s important to note that in the EventEmitter that comes built-in with Node you must pass a reference to the exact function you wish to remove when using the removeListener method. This means wherever you wish to remove the event, you’ll need to make sure the function is able to be referenced from that place in your code. For this reason it is often best to name your event handling functions and declaring them before you register the event listener, as opposed to leaving them anonymous.

In the following example, it would be a challenge to remove the listener for the message event from outside of the userJoined function due to the fact that it’s an anonymous function declared within a closure. In this case the only place we would be able to directly reference this method would be in the EventEmitter Object itself. This would be impractical if we ever had more than one listener registered to a single event as we would then have to figure out a way to decipher which of the listeners is our intended target.
