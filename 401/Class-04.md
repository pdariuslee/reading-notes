# Readings: Data Modeling & NoSQL Database

1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?

    - Models promote consensus among developers, customers and other stakeholders.

    - A data model also promotes agreement on vocabulary and jargon. The model highlights the chosen terms so that they can be driven forward into software artifacts. The resulting software becomes easier to maintain and extend.

2. What purpose do CRUD operations serve?

    - In computer programming, create, read (aka retrieve), update, and delete[1] (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage.[2] Alternate words are sometimes used when defining the four basic functions of CRUD, such as retrieve instead of read, modify instead of update, or destroy instead of delete. CRUD is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information, often using computer-based forms and reports. The term was likely first popularized by James Martin in his 1983 book Managing the Data-base Environment.[1][3] The acronym may be extended to CRUDL to cover listing of large data sets which bring additional complexity such as pagination when the data sets are too large to be easily held in memory.

3. What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?

    - PostgreSQL is a traditional RDBMS (relational database management system) SQL database, like Oracle and MySQL. PostgreSQL is free.

    - MongoDB is a no-schema, noSQL, JSON database. MongoDB has a free version, but they also have hosted and enterprise paid versions. Even the free version includes free cloud monitoring hosted on their site for your local installation.

4. What is Mongoose and why do we need it?

    - Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
