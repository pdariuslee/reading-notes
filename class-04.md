## Chapter 4: "Links"

- Links

  - Are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> and closing </a> tag.
  
  - The `<a>` uses href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
  
  - If linking to a page within your own site, it's best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

## Chapter 3: "Functions, Methods, and Objects"

- Function let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse function
(rather than repeating the same set of statements).

- Variables Scope

  - Local Variables
  
    - A variable created inside a function using the var keyword, it can only be used in that function. 
    
    - It is called **local variable** or **function-level variable**
  
 - Global Variables
  
   - If you create a variable outside of a function, then it can be used anywhere within the script. 
   
   - It is called a **global variable** and has a **global scope**.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

 1. Greater Efficiency
 
     - In the long run, pair programming might take slightly longer but if pair programmers work together on separate features of the system and when stuck both can do research
     about the challenge/s, which makes pair programming better than one.
 
 2. Engaged Collaboration
 
    - More engaging and more focused than working alone.
 
 3. Learning from fellow students
 
    - Working with others opens up possibility of learning something new.
 
 4. Social Skills
 
    - When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key, so you get to improve these aspects.
 
 5. Job Interview Readiness
 
    - A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant. Which means if you're used to working with
    others, it will be an advantage than just working by yourself for a long time.
 
 6. Work Environment Readiness
  
    - A lot of organizations/companies adapt pair programming expecting to train fresh hires. If someone is familiar with how pair programming works, work
    transition would be easier.
